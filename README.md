# Templated-Vector

In this project, we implement a templated class called Vector that is essentially a variable length array. The Vector can grow as necessary as new elements are added to the array. Further we will implement a iterator called VectorIterator that exists to “refer to”, or “point to” an existing element in the Vector. 

The templated vector supports all functionality of standard vector class provided in C++. There is also support for iterators. 

The project is implemented in C++.
